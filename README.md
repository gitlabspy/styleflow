# StyleFlow (unoffical) and more
\[WIP\]A runnable face editing thing on colab/jupyter. SeFa, Ganspace are also supported.

## TODO:
- GAN Inversion requires noise to be fixed.
- Implement Lpips. Lpips is much more useful than Image2StyleGAN.

## requirements
- tensorflow >= 2.3
- tensorflow_probability >= 0.11
